# Want to join us?

Every 2 months we start a new class with talented refugees who want to start their career in web-development. 

Weâ€™re looking for people who are very motivated and are willing to put in a lot of hours in order to become great at coding. 

You will need to have an intermediate level in English and you will need to study for around 25 hours per week, with a physical class every Sunday. (and occasional masterclasses during the week)
